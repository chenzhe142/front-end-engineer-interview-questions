# JavaScript

## `Function.prototype.apply` vs `Function.prototype.call`
`.apply` will be effected for a list of elements, and may be called multiple times (depends on the number of arguments provided)
`.call` will only be called once

## `Array.prototype.map` vs `Array.prototype.forEach`
`.map` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array.
`.forEach` excutes a callback function for each element

## `Array` vs `Object`
Array is object, but object is not array. Array is based on object, with its own unique prototype methods.
